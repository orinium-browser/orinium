//! CSS Parser
//!
//! Consumes tokens produced by the tokenizer and builds
//! higher-level CSS syntax structures.
//!
//! ## Responsibilities
//! - Parse token streams into structured CSS data
//!   (selectors, declarations, component values)
//! - Handle nesting such as blocks and functions
//!
//! ## Non-responsibilities
//! - Tokenization of raw input
//! - Semantic interpretation (length resolution, color computation, etc.)
//!
//! ## Design notes
//! - No property-specific validation is performed here
//! - Semantic meaning is assigned in later stages (style computation, layout)
