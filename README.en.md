## An Independent Browser Free from Google
The source code of this browser engine **does not depend on Google**.  
Except for a few browsers like Firefox, most browsers in the world rely on Googleâ€™s Chromium.  
This project aims to provide a new browser engine as an alternative to Chromium.

## Unique Extension Format
In the future, this browser engine will support extensions. The planned formats include:
* Oriniumâ€™s original format  
* Firefox add-ons  
* Chromium manifest v2 (partial support)

Supporting these formats helps maintain compatibility with other browsers, while unique features designed specifically for Orinium will provide a better user experience.
